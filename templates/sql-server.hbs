Note that the below template is rendered once for each entity returned by the doLookup method.  This renders
the "Detail Block" within the notification window which is the data you see when clicking on an entity "Summary Block".
In this template we are iterating over all the key-value pairs in `block.data.details` which maps directly back to
object we returned from our doLookup method inside `integration.js`
